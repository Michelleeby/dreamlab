# Template for Getting Started with Our Team
This guide is for student supervisors to use in conjunction with the [Getting Started](getting_started.pptx) presentation. This can easily be adapted for whatever management tools and software your team uses.

## Before the Students Arrive
1. (If you are using [Trello](https://trello.com) or [OSF](https://osf.io) a similar project management tool) Invite students to Team Trello board and/or Team OSF.
2. (If you are using [Slack](https://slack.com/) or a similar workspace communication tool) Invite students to Team Slack.
3. Invite students to Team Github account (if there are seats) OR add them as collaborators on all repos they will be working on.
4. Spin up student cloud-hosted development servers (if you are doing Activity #4 in the command line workshop, you won't need to configure them at all - just create them!) and email the students their IPs.
5. (If students will need access to your production hosted environments such as [Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com/)) Invite students to team hosting accounts.
6. Organize student payroll T_T

## On the First Day
During the [Getting Started](getting_started.pptx) presentation:
1. Do introductions and go over expectations
2. Provide a tour of the work space
3. Introduce all the projects the student team will work on during this semester. After showing off the projects and what types of roles you are looking for to work on them, you can either:
  - Give the students projects assignments you have already made
  - Allow some time for them to read through project proposals and charters to decide which roles they would like to fill and which projects they would like to work on (the Project Profile sheets can be very helpful in streamlining this process).
  - Allow returning students to select their projects and assign new students to the roles that remain.
4. Have the students verify that they received invites and test logging in to the following:
  - Slack
  - Github team account or collaborator invites
  - Trello 
  - OSF
  - Reclaim or other cloud hosting
  - Any payroll related sites
5. (If you are not doing Activity #3 in the Command Line workshop) Have the students test `ssh`ing in to their dev environment cloud hosted servers
6. Allow time for students to install everything they will need on their computers (see slides)
7. Do the team webpage Jekyll activity (this is much easier if you have at least two students who already know Git, otherwise you may need to give them the commands they will need to work with Github pages)
