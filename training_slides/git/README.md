## Workshop Prep & Activities
### Everyone
1. Create an account at https://github.com/
2. Download Atom from https://atom.io/

### Windows Users
1. Install Git Bash by downloading [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). During install, make sure to select:
  1. "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt"
  2. "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings"
  3. "Use Windows' default console window"
2. If your "HOME" environment variable is not set (or you don't know what this is):
  1. Open Start Menu and type `cmd` - This opens the command prompt.
  2. Type this line exactly as shown: `setx HOME "%USERPROFILE%"`
  3. Press Enter and you should see: `SUCCESS: Specified value was saved.`
  4. Type `exit` and press Enter to quite the command prompt.

### Mac and Linux Users
1. **For OS X 10.9 and higher**, install Git for Mac by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from [this list](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/) (click the large green button "Download Latest Version").
2. **For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)** use the most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard" [available here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/) (you will have to scroll down the list until you see a link labelled git-X.X.X-intel-universal-snow-leopard.dmg").
3. **Note!** After installing Git, there will not be anything in your /Applications folder, as Git is a command line program.

### Post-Workshop Recommended Activities
