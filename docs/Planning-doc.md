# Expansive and Inclusive Digital Scholarly Production in the Library

This class is designed for people who currently, or may someday, work in Libraries. Over the course of four days, the group will explore and develop approaches to creating and supporting new modes of digital expression in collaboration with library colleagues, with researchers, and with students.

## Topics will include:

**Experimental forms of publishing**

-   Introduction to Markup and Markdown
-   Databases, websites, content management systems, static site generators â€“ when and why do people choose these?
-   What is a publication? Review, timescale, collaborative authorship, etc
-   In what ways do these questions intersect with systems of power, and how can mindful approaches to those systems help shape our practices?

**Sustainability and scalability for projects and services**

-   How long do various forms of data last, and under what circumstances? Who decides?
-   What is a project? What is a service? When does it matter?
-   What participant and infrastructural roles support successful collaborative projects and services while honoring participant labor?

**Collections as data**

-   Exploration of examples from libraries, archives, and museum collections.
-   How can collections be made available as data?
-   What ethical and practical considerations should be taken into account when approaching Collections as Data?

**Project management lessons**

-   Project management and planning tools
-   Models for collaboration and resources for further research

At the end, each participant will have a plan for a project of their own, or for a new collaborative approach to service development.
