                        ## 1. Making a Single Project Plan
                        - Applications are solicited and processed through the Price Lab for Digital Humanities & library liaisons
                        - Based on the project needs, Scott or Sasha is selected as project lead
                        - Meet with project owners to develop a charter
                        - Must list all deliverables in detail
                        - All deliverables must have a timeline
                        - Communication expectations for both our team and project owner are detailed

                    <textarea data-template>
                        ## 2. Making a Semester Plan 
                        - Once a single project charter has been completed, generate:
                        - List of all technical skills required
                        - Student time estimates per skill set
                        - From all charters selected for a semester, generate a list of all needed skills
                        - Generate “roles” based on collections of skills that students could be expected to learn in a single semester

                    <textarea data-template>
                        ## 3. Build Your Team!
                        - Advertise! Advertise! Advertise!
                        - Visit classes in Humanities & SS
                        - Visit campus cultural and academic organizations
                        - Attend job fairs
                        - Bring handouts that include what the students will learn and project snapshots
                        - Hire as diverse a group as possible
                        - 2-4 CS students, 3-6 humanities & SS students
                        - 50/50 graduate and undergrad
                        - Incentivize returners

                        - Students train as a group

                        - Students are paired or grouped, try to ensure at least one returner or CS student per project to act as mentor
                        - Select a “training project” for each student team that will introduce skills
                    </textarea>
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    <textarea data-template>
                        ## 5. Hack!
                        - Student deliverables are broken down into specific tasks with real deadlines
                        - Meet with student teams at least once/week to assess progress
                        - Bi-weekly meetings with project owners to demonstrate deliverables or designs
                        - Code reviews once per month to discuss student style
                    </textarea>
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    <textarea data-template>
                        ## 6. Launch the Projects
                        - Project officially launches when all deliverables from charter are met to both parties satisfaction
                        - No pressure to launch! - If either side of the team does not feel the work is ready for launch, it is moved into the next work cycle
                        - If the patrons request features not originally in the charter, the project launches in Phase 1, with Phase 2 planned for next work cycle to address additional requests
                        - During the launch preparation, students test their work by installing their code on a brand new instance
                        - Code is available through Github
                        - Must have a detailed Readme
