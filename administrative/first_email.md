## Sample First Email

Hi Everyone,

Welcome to the Digital Scholarship Team! (Or -- Welcome Back!) We're writing to coordinate the first weeks of work. We're taking on lots of new projects this semester, get a sneak peak of what’s to come at the end of this email. Some of you may be ready to work on one of these projects right away; others will need to spend some time getting to know the software we use.

Your first day of work is [INSERT FIRST DAY] at [INSERT START TIME]. Please report to [INSERT WORK STATION].

Summer Schedule: Mon-Fri, 9am-5pm (with one hour for lunch), May 21-Aug 10

If you will not be available to work anytime during those weeks, or you have requested to work something other than the standard hours, please email me immediately! We are creating the final copy of the schedule and I want to be sure I have the correct times and dates from everyone.

Dress code: Casual - what you would normally wear to the library. Jeans are fine, hoodies are fine (it gets pretty cold in our offices). Please, no sweat pants/pajama pants.

Please bring a laptop and charger with you OR let me know if I need to provide you with one.

If you plan to pack a lunch, there is a microwave and fridge available.

Please also respond to this email with a photo of yourself for our directory and any food allergies you have.

Please feel free to contact us with any other questions.

Selected Semester Projects

[INSERT PROJECT SNAPSHOTS]

Sample Project: Penn Omeka Plugins & Themes Suite - During the last two years, the Digital Scholarship team has designed a suite of custom content management system plugins and themes, including special mapping, archaeobotany, and art “shopping” interfaces. The goal of this project is to generalize and combine (where possible) these plugins and themes into a suite that can be released for general Omeka users.
