## Sample Position Descriptions

We organize our students into roles that possess skill sets they can apply to several different projects during a semester. Prior to the start of the semester, we create these sets of recommended roles that the students are either assigned or can choose from. During the assignment session, we provide role sheets that list the skills needed or to be developed for a role, the projects they will work on, and the estimated timeline.

The process for generating these sheets:
1. We map out three columns: the projects, the skills needed to complete the projects, and the students (with notes on the skills they already have)
2. We draw lines between the columns first to create a best fit for groups of similar skills across projects
3. Then we draw lines to the students with estimates about who would best fill those roles. We end up with something akin to a Sankey diagram
4. Using this diagram, we create our role sheets that list all the skills for a single role, all the projects assigned to that role, and then try to make reasonable time estimates based on how many roles are assigned to each project
